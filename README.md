# Customer Churn Prediction Model using Decision Trees

Our case study focuses on a churn dataset, where "churned customers" are those ending relationships with their current company. XYZ, a service provider, offers a one-year subscription plan and wants to predict customer renewal.

## Description

A Decision Tree is a supervised learning method suitable for both classification and regression tasks, often used for solving classification problems. It's structured as a tree-like classifier, with nodes representing dataset features, branches as decision rules, and leaf nodes as outcomes.

This graphical representation offers potential solutions based on given conditions. Beginning from a root node, it grows branches and forms a tree structure. The tree poses questions and branches further based on Yes/No answers.

Our case study focuses on a churn dataset, where "churned customers" are those ending relationships with their current company. XYZ, a service provider, offers a one-year subscription plan and wants to predict customer renewal.

Previously, we explored logistic regression on this dataset. It's recommended to review the [Build a Logistic Regression Model] project. Now, we aim to apply the decision tree classifier to the same dataset.
